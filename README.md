This google site chronicles the semester-long journey of developing our tutor-student matchmaking app, Tutor Recruiter. While the final prototype is sadly unavailable due to a lapse in Proto.io license, the rest of the design process is there, from rapid prototyping, design iteration, wireframing, meeting with clients, usability testing, and even persona creation, the full design lifecycle can be seen.
